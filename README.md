# Tree.NFT Framework
The home of the Tree.NFT framework. - [Currently in v.01](https://github.com/tiamoesg/trees.NFT/blob/main/tree-nft.json)

# Tree.NFT Framework
1. A public good NFT framework for turning trees into RWAs. 
2. To allow regenerative finance to move forward into its next stage of IRL implementation.
3. To create easily scalable decentralized projects of conservation, reforestation, and production.

# Current Development
1. Next.JS storefront for launching RWAs to the public via fiat on-ramps. Link to temp CMV3 UI >> [First Test - CM Error](https://trees-nft.vercel.app/) |  [Code](https://github.com/tiamoesg/trees.NFT/tree/main/pages) -- and here is where our future development will start with Next.JS [Ground Up Build](https://github.com/tiamoesg/RWAdrops.store)
2. Tree.NFTv01 Structure + Attribute Development [Current Structure Example](https://github.com/tiamoesg/trees.NFT/blob/main/tree-nft.json) 

# Future Development -- Tree.NFT
1. Getting Tree.NFT structure to v1 >>
2. Identifying most necessary and valuable attributes
3. Creating templates for multiple tree types
4. Adding calculations for production averages, ROIs, and oxygen creation. 

# Future Development -- Communication and Partnerships
1. Creating material to communicate the framework and how to use it.
2. Providing access to tools and education necessary in order to effectively create campaigns and utilize RWAs
3. Align with other organizations and projects around the world in order to implement more traceability and integrity into the Climate Change and Regenerative Finance sectors.

# Future Development -- RWAdrops
1. Launching first tree RWA NFT project. CMv3 is already loaded with 7000 trees [Collection on Solscan](https://solscan.io/token/AiFeb2oxur5Kd625kDmvC86mQuet76Yazxwp7GnB24af)
2. Attemped with templates for CMv3, couldn't succeed. 
3. Tried with Crossmint, error when trying to buy credits for production.
4. Attemped withpaper.com, didn't provide.
5. Can get everything to function on devnet.... but not mainnet.
6. Need some help on moving to the next step.
